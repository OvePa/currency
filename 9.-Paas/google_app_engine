Deploying WSGI Python app
There are only two files needed to deploy a WSGI Python application in the Google App Engine:

* app.yaml which contains the application metadata and the address of the main module to run.
* At least one Python file that contains the code to run. Obviously, it can be an entire
Python module with subdirectories.

Steps to deploy an application
Following are the steps needed to deploy a WSGI app to Google App Engine:

1.- In the folder containing the app, enter command gcloud app deploy. If you see
an error that you are not logged in, then use the command gcloud auth login to
login into a Google account.

2.- Enter y to continue deploying.

Your application will be deployed!

You can access the application using command curl https://scapytest.appspot.com/.
Use your own app URL provided when the application is deployed.
