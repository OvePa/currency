Steps to deploy an app on Heroku:
Once you are in the folder containing the app (you will be in the heroku-app
folder when you launch the terminal below), enter command heroku login --interactive,
and log in with your Heroku account.
Once you are logged in, enter the command heroku create.
Once the app is created, commit the changes to GitHub using commands:
git init
git add .
git config --global user.email "your_email@email.com"
git commit -m 'Initial import'
Then, push the app using these commands:
git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/murmuring-fortress-09478.git -
use your app GitHub link displayed when you created heroku app in step 2.
git push heroku master
Your app is now deployed!

You can use the command curl https://murmuring-fortress-09478.herokuapp.com/
to get a response from the app. Use your own URL that is provided when the app
is successfully deployed.
