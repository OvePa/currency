Steps to deploy application
Following are the steps to deploy your application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

In the folder containing the application, run the command eb init your_app_name.

Enter eb create. Press enter for using default environment name and DNS CNAME
prefix or choose a custom one.

Select the load balancer type by entering the relevant option number (1 is the
default for classic).

Enter your aws-access-id and aws-secret-key.

Type view to view the policy or just press Enter to continue.

Your application will be deployed!

You can enter curl -v http://scapytest-dev.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/ to
get the response from your app. Use your own app URL is provided in the form of
CNAME when the app is deployed.

As shown in the above steps, the command line tool eb provided by awsebcli makes
it very easy to deploy a Python application in a few commands. And like all cloud
providers, AWS provides autoscaling features based on several different metrics
(CPU usage, network bandwidth, etc).

Since Elastic Beanstalk is based on other Amazon services such as EC2, it can be
handy to use and you can also leverage other services.
